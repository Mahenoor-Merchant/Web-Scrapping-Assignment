    "## Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using software or tools, in an automated or manual manner. This data can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured, and can include text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, including market research, lead generation, content creation, and data analysis. It can help individuals and businesses gain insights into trends, competitors, customer preferences, and other aspects of the online landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three areas where web scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: Web scraping can be used to extract product information, prices, and reviews from e-commerce websites such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. This data can be used to compare prices, analyze customer feedback, and identify opportunities for product optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media: Web scraping can be used to extract data from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. This data can include user profiles, comments, likes, and shares, and can be used for sentiment analysis, audience segmentation, and content creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research: Web scraping can be used to extract data from academic journals, news websites, and other online sources. This data can be used for literature reviews, data analysis, and other research purposes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual scraping: This method involves manually copying and pasting data from websites into a spreadsheet or database. This method is time-consuming and requires a lot of effort, but it can be useful for small-scale data extraction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated scraping: This method uses software or tools to automate the data extraction process. Here are some common automated scraping techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping libraries: Programming languages such as Python, R, and Ruby have libraries that can be used to extract data from websites. Examples include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser extensions: Browser extensions such as Web Scraper, Data Miner, and Scraper can be used to extract data from websites directly from your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions: Regular expressions can be used to extract data from websites by matching patterns in the HTML code. This method can be useful for simple data extraction tasks, but it can be less reliable than other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that not all web scraping methods are legal, and some websites have measures in place to prevent scraping. It's important to check the terms of service of a website before scraping it, and to respect any restrictions or guidelines that are in place."

    "## Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes. It provides a set of functions and tools that allow users to extract data from HTML and XML files. Beautiful Soup is widely used for web scraping due to its ease of use, flexibility, and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key features of Beautiful Soup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing HTML and XML files: Beautiful Soup can be used to parse HTML and XML files and extract data from them. It handles malformed HTML and XML files well, making it a reliable choice for web scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating the parse tree: Beautiful Soup provides a simple syntax for navigating the parse tree and locating specific elements in the HTML or XML file. This makes it easy to extract specific data points from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with other Python libraries: Beautiful Soup can be easily integrated with other Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, making it a versatile tool for web scraping and data analysis.\n"

    "## Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework that is commonly used in web development projects, including web scraping projects. Flask is used in this web scraping project for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing: Flask provides a simple and intuitive routing system that allows developers to map URLs to functions. This makes it easy to build a web interface for the web scraping project and allows users to interact with the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Templating: Flask also includes a templating engine that allows developers to create dynamic HTML pages. This can be useful for displaying the scraped data in a user-friendly format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with other libraries: Flask can be easily integrated with other Python libraries that are commonly used in web scraping projects, such as Beautiful Soup and Pandas. This allows developers to build a complete web scraping workflow using a combination of different tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to set up and deploy: Flask is lightweight and easy to set up and deploy, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized web scraping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Flask is used in this web scraping projects because it provides a simple and intuitive routing system, a templating engine for creating dynamic HTML pages, and can be easily integrated with other Python libraries commonly used in web scraping. It is also lightweight and easy to set up and deploy, making it a popular choice for web scraping projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The AWS Services used in the project were CODE PIPELINE and BEANSTALK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USE OF AWS CodePipeline:\n",
    "AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that automates the build, test, and deployment of applications. It allows developers to define a series of stages in a pipeline, each of which performs a specific action such as building code, running tests, and deploying applications. CodePipeline integrates with a variety of AWS services, including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, as well as third-party tools, making it a flexible and customizable solution for continuous delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USE OF BEANSTALK\n",
    "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that provides developers with a convenient and easy way to deploy, manage, and scale their web applications and services on AWS. It offers a variety of use cases, such as application deployment, scaling, monitoring and logging, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and cost-effective hosting. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can deploy their applications to the cloud, regardless of the language or framework used, and the service will handle the underlying infrastructure and scaling. "
